## 🖼️ Image Asset Policy (Copyright-Safe)

This project includes local fallback images specifically to avoid broken third-party URLs and reduce copyright risk on deployment.

- Local fallback assets are stored in `public/images/fallback` and `public/images/activities`
- Fallback SVG images in those folders are original project assets (created for this codebase)
- UI components use a fallback chain: API image -> alternate API image -> local themed fallback -> local default fallback
- This strategy keeps image rendering stable in Vercel even when external image links are unavailable

If you add new images for production content:

1. Use assets with clear usage rights (CC0/Public Domain/owned assets)
2. Prefer hosting in your own storage or `public/images/*`
3. Keep attribution metadata when required by license terms
